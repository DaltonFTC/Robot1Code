-= Note =-
These drivers are for RobotC 2.00 and higher and are part of the
version 2.3 of the 3rd Party RobotC Drivers suite.

What's new in 2.3?
* More fixes in the DIMU driver:
  * Fixed a bug in the accelerometer driver (thanks Sven Koehler)
  * X and Y axes are now switched in the gyro to match that of the accelerometer (thanks Aswin Bouwmeester)
* Added new Mindsensors RCX motor MUX driver.  This driver was written entirely by Daniel Playfair Cal. Slight documentation mods by me.

Just point your browser at the index.html file.
